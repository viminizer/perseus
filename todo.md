### Creating a unified request panel

Currently

- body and headers are separate panels for request
- takes too much space

Goal

- make them into a single panel
- body and headers must be a separate tabs inside request panel

Example Behavior

- response panel has a very similar behavior, you can implement the same behavior and ui for request
  panel as well.
- keep the placeholders

Before writing the plan

- suggest me improvements and ask me to verify
- ask me question in case you need clarification
- try to imitate postman's behavior
