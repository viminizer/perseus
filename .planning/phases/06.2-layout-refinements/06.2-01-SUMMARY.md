# Phase 6.2: Layout & Behavior Refinements — Plan 01 Summary

## What Was Accomplished

Refined the UI layout and navigation behavior based on Phase 6.1 feedback:

1. **Method popup positioning** — Popup now appears anchored below the method box instead of centered on screen
2. **Method name centering** — Method text is center-aligned with padding in its box
3. **Horizontal h/l navigation** — h/l now navigates between Method and URL fields instead of cycling methods
4. **Sidebar toggle** — Ctrl+E toggles sidebar visibility
5. **Response panel repositioned** — Response now renders below body at 40% height (vertical layout)
6. **Insert mode cursor** — Cursor changes to underscore when entering insert mode

### Files Modified

- `src/app.rs` — Added sidebar_visible state, Ctrl+E handler, cursor style changes, removed method cycling
- `src/ui/mod.rs` — Updated render to conditionally show sidebar, centered method text, pass method_area to popup
- `src/ui/layout.rs` — Changed to vertical layout (request 60% / response 40%), sidebar toggle support

## Issues Encountered

None — all 6 tasks completed as specified.

## Deviations from Plan

- Removed unused `next()` and `prev()` methods from HttpMethod after h/l behavior change (dead code cleanup)

## Verification

- `cargo build` passes (1 warning: unused Sidebar panel variant — expected, reserved for future)

## Checklist

- [x] Method popup anchored to method box
- [x] Method name centered with padding
- [x] h/l navigates horizontally between fields
- [x] Ctrl+E toggles sidebar
- [x] Response below body at ~40% height
- [x] Underscore cursor in insert mode
