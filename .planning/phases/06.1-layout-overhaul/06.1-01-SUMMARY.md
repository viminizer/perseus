# Phase 6.1: Layout Overhaul — Plan 01 Summary

## What Was Accomplished

Transformed the Perseus TUI layout from vertical stacked panels to a Postman-style layout with:

1. **Sidebar placeholder** — Empty "Collections" panel on the left side (20 chars or 15% width)
2. **Horizontal request input row** — Method, URL, and Send button in a single row
3. **Method selector popup** — Centered modal with colored methods and vim-style j/k navigation
4. **Colored HTTP methods** — GET (Green), POST (Blue), PUT (Yellow), PATCH (Magenta), DELETE (Red)

### Files Modified

- `src/ui/layout.rs` — Added sidebar_area, RequestInputLayout struct
- `src/ui/mod.rs` — Added render_sidebar, render_method_popup, method_color helper
- `src/app.rs` — Added popup state fields, Sidebar panel variant, keyboard handling

| 8 | `04c5924` | feat(6.1-01): update focus handling for new layout |

## Issues Encountered

- **Minor:** Build errors after Task 2 due to changed layout field paths — fixed by updating render_request_panel to use new input_row substructure
- **Warning:** `Panel::Sidebar` variant is unused (expected - reserved for future Collections panel focus)

## Deviations from Plan

- None — all 8 tasks completed as specified

## Verification

- `cargo build` passes (1 warning: unused Sidebar variant)
- `cargo build --release` passes
- App compiles and runs successfully

## Checklist

- [x] Sidebar visible on left (empty placeholder)
- [x] Method/URL/Send in horizontal row
- [x] Enter on Method opens popup
- [x] j/k navigates popup, Enter selects
- [x] Methods display in their distinct colors
- [x] All existing functionality preserved
