**Status:** Complete
**Timeline:** 2026-02-04
**Commits:** 30
**LOC:** 768

## Summary

A terminal-based HTTP client with vim-style keybindings. Built with ratatui + tokio + reqwest.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Foundation** — Rust TUI app with ratatui + tokio, panic handling, clean terminal lifecycle
2. **TUI Layout** — Split-panel design with request/response areas, bordered widgets
3. **Keyboard Navigation** — Tab panel switching, j/k field navigation, h/l method cycling
4. **HTTP Client** — Async requests via reqwest, non-blocking UI with channels
5. **Response Display** — JSON syntax highlighting, status coloring, header formatting
6. **Vim-style UX** — Normal/Insert modes, i/Esc toggling, status bar with key hints, response scrolling

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal:** Project setup with ratatui + tokio, basic app loop running

- Fix Cargo.toml (edition 2021)
- Add dependencies: ratatui, crossterm, tokio, reqwest
- Create basic Application struct with event loop
- Terminal setup/teardown with panic handler
- Verify app starts and exits cleanly

**Plans:** 1-1 (3 tasks)

### Phase 2: TUI Layout
**Goal:** Panel layout with request/response areas and navigation

- Define UI layout (request panel left/top, response panel right/bottom)
- Implement panel components with borders and titles
- Add input widgets: URL field, method selector, headers, body
- Keyboard navigation between panels and fields
- Focus indicators and visual feedback

**Plans:** 2-1 (6 tasks)

### Phase 3: HTTP Integration
**Goal:** Make requests and display responses beautifully

- Wire up reqwest client with tokio runtime
- Send request on user action (Enter key)
- Parse and display response: status, headers, body
- JSON syntax highlighting for response body
- Loading indicator during request
- Error display for failed requests

**Plans:** 3-1 (6 tasks)

### Phase 4: Polish
**Goal:** Smooth keyboard UX and visual refinement

- Vim-style keybindings (hjkl navigation, i for insert)
- Tab completion or method cycling
- Status bar with help hints
- Color scheme and visual consistency
- Edge case handling (large responses, timeouts)

**Plans:** 4-1 (6 tasks)
